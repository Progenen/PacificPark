        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>A crown is a complete covering of the anatomic crown of the tooth with the intent to improve and restore the
            existing tooth structure. Crowns on the front teeth are used for a few specific reasons.</p>
        <ul center="">
            <li>To reinforce a weakened tooth</li>
            <li>To change contour and anatomy of a tooth</li>
            <li>To change a color of a tooth</li>
            <li>To change length of a tooth</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How it is accomplished</h2>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul class="landing__list-curname">
            <li>
                <span class="text-right">Zirconia</span>
                <span>Also known as zirconia based ceramics are the strongest ceramic materials available in dentistry
                    today. The trade off of the material is that it is the least esthetic. Zirconia crowns always look
                    flatter in color and do not have the depth and translucency that natural teeth display. This
                    material is ideal for molar crowns in the back of the mouth.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-right">Porcelain</span>
                <span>The best looking material available in dentistry. Glassy matrix of porcelain materials creates
                    translucency and depth of colors that is found in natural teeth. This also happens to be the weakest
                    type of crown material. Perfect use of porcelain would be on the front teeth where biting stresses
                    are smallest and need for esthetic appearance is greatest.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span class="text-right">Metal-alloys</span>
                <span>Gold crowns fall into this category of materials. Historically this is the least esthetic material
                    however it has been time tested and found to have the longest service life. In addition this
                    material allows  the restoration to be more conservative thereby saving more tooth structure. This
                    material is ideal for teeth with low esthetic but high stress environments such as molar teeth on
                    someone who has a  clenching or grinding habit.</span>
