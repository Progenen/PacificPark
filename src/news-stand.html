        <h3>Flexible Financing</h3>

        <h3>IV Sedation</h3>
        <p>We now offer a sedation option that allows even the most anxious patients to undergo treatment. With this
            level of sedation no intubation is necessary, while allowing the breathing mechanisms to function on their
            own. The patient will remember very little of treatment after the medications wear off.</p>
        <h3>State, Medicaid, DSHS carriers</h3>
        <p>We have the ability to do full mouth extractions and dentures under the state carriers. The surgery
            appointment is usually scheduled within 2-4 weeks of the initial appointment date. After a few weeks of
            healing our friends at Evergreen Denture Center will take over the denture fabrication steps</p>
        <p>State insurances will also cover complete wisdom tooth extractions for patients age 15-20 with IV sedation
            included if necessary</p>
        <h3>Charitable Dentistry</h3>
        <p>Giving back to the community is one of our favorite things to do. We participate in the HALO Dental Network
            in order to help the individuals in dire need. You can find some of the charity work documented in the Case
            Presentations section. Please refer to the link below to find out more about the HALO Dental Network</p>

        <h3>Extended Appointment Deposits</h3>
        <p>When booking extended appointments we will require a deposit to secure your spot. The deposit is refunded if
            the appointment is cancelled at least 24 hours in advance. Cancellations within 24 hours prior to the
            appointment time will not be refunded.</p>
        <h3>Giving to the Community</h3>
        <p>At Pacific Park Family Dental we make it our mission to donate 20% of net proceeds to local charities,
            ministries and people in need</p>
