        <p>Commonly known as deep cleaning, scaling will remove calculus from root surfaces. Within a short time after
            treatment gums will firm up and return to a natural pink color.</p>

        <p>Plaque is made of left over food particles. Over time plaque becomes calcified leading to formation of
            calculus.</p>

        <p>Calculus will irritate the gums making them tender and sensitive. With time you may notice bleeding gums
            during brushing or flossing, as well as a stale, uncomfortable smell coming from the mouth.</p>

        <p>Once all the irritants are removed gums will start repairing themselves. However the lost bone and gum levels
            will not return without surgical involvement. Also this level of cleaning is recommended at frequency of 3-4
            months in order to maintain cleanliness and health.</p>
