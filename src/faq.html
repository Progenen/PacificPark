        <h3>Do you accept Molina, Provider One and Apple Health for dentistry?</h3>
        <p>Yes we do</p>
        <h3>What insurances do you accept?</h3>

        <h3>How quickly will I get my prescription at the pharmacy?</h3>
        <p>We recommend waiting at least 2 hours before picking up medications at the pharmacy. Sometimes pharmacies are
            able to fill a prescription faster, but the rule of thumb is to allow some time to have the prescriptions to
            be received and filled by the pharmacy.</p>
