        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p class="text-center">This is typically a solution of last resort</p>
        <p class="text-center">Removal of a tooth is recommended when</p>
        <ul center="">
            <li>Tooth is broken beyond restorability</li>
            <li>Tooth is infected</li>

            <li>It is wisdom tooth</li>

        <p class="text-center"> Because wisdom teeth can pose significant health risks later in life

            it is recommended to have the removed fairly early on for the following reasons: </p>

            <li>Bone is flexible and not fragile</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="text-center">Leaving wisdom teeth in can cause significant health complications

            later in life such as:</p>

            <li>Bone loss around 2nd molars leading to tooth loss</li>
            <li>2nd molar tooth decay</li>
            <li>Soft tissue infections</li>
            <li>Cyst and tumors associated with wisdom tooth presence</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>How it is accomplished</h2>
        <p>There is a certain amount of fear that accompanies this procedure for the specific reason is that there is
            anticipation of pain. Our advanced techniques make it possible to circumvent the discomfort and the anxiety
            in order to have a low stress, comfortable visit.</p>
        <p>During the procedure we will walk you through of what to expect and what is normal and not normal to feel. We
            will equip you to appropriately handle the operative stress and communicate any discomfort you may be
            experiencing.</p>
        <p>For certain cases it is necessary to have the added benefit of sedation, we offer multiple varieties of
            sedation that can benefit event the most anxious of our patients. The types of sedation offered are:</p>
        <ul class="landing__list-curname">
            <li> <span class="text-right">Laughing gas sedation</span> <span> This is a nitrous oxide gas that is
                    administered to patients who want to feel more comfortable
                    during a procedure, however anxiety reduction with this method can range from minimal to moderate.
                </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Medication sedation</span> <span> This is a medication that is administered to
                    patients 30-60 minutes before the visit. This
                    medication can cause other side effects such as drowsiness and dizziness, however anxiety reduction
                    with this method can range from minimal to substantial depending on the persons physiology. These
                    patients require a driver to be present after the appointment. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Combination of Laughing
                    gas and
                    anxiety
                    reducing medications</span> <span> The combination of both methods has an additive effect in
                    reducing anxiety that ranges from moderate
                    to profound. Some patients have reports experiencing absence of memory while under the influence of
                    these sedation methods, other side effects include drowsiness and dizziness. These patients require
                    a driver to be present after the appointment. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">IV Sedation</span> <span> This method of sedation offers an ideal level of
                    anxiety reduction as well as loss of memory while
                    under the influence of sedation medications. These patients require a driver to be present after the
                    appointment. </span> </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>After Removal of Tooth </h2>
        <div class="landing__image landing__image--double"> <img src="images/landing-img111.png" alt="">
            <img src="images/landing-img112.png" alt=""> </div>
        <ul center="">
            <li>Keep pressure on the wound</li>
            <li>Stay away from spicy foods</li>
            <li>Stay away from crunchy foods</li>
            <li>Stay away from strenuous physical activity</li>
            <li>Stay away from smoking</li>
            <li>Take pain medications before anesthetic wears off</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Post operative complications</h2>
        <ul class="landing__list-curname">
            <li> <span class="text-right">Dry Socket</span> <span> This is a common complication associated with the
                    loss of clot within the socket. A symptom of dry socket is radiating pain that doesn't diminish with
                    any kind of pain medication regiment. Other symptoms present are unpleasant taste and smell
                    emanating from the affected area. Although benign, dry socket is extremely unpleasant, call your

                    dental provider to manage this complication. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Bleeding</span> <span> This is a common complication that is treated with some
                    pressure on the wound. If bleeding is slowing down but is taking time to form a clot we ask our
                    patients to bite on a teabag of black tea. The tannic acid in the black tea will encourage a clot to
                    form faster. If other concerns are present please call your dental provider. </span> </li>
