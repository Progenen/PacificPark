        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>A crown is a complete covering of the anatomic crown of the tooth with the intent to improve and restore the
            existing tooth structure. Crowns are used for a variety of purposes</p>
        <ul center="">
            <li>To reinforce a weakened tooth</li>
            <li>To change contour and anatomy of a tooth</li>
            <li>To change a color of a tooth</li>
            <li>To change length of a tooth</li>

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul class="landing__list-curname">
            <li> <span class="text-right">Zirconia</span> <span> Also known as zirconia based ceramics are the strongest
                    ceramic materials available in dentistry today. The trade off of the material is that it is the
                    least esthetic. Zirconia crowns always look flatter in color and do not have the depth and
                    translucency that natural teeth display. This material is ideal for molar crowns in the back of the
                    mouth. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Porcelain</span> <span> The best looking material available in dentistry.
                    Glassy matrix of porcelain materials creates translucency and depth of colors that is found in
                    natural teeth. This also happens to be the weakest type of crown material. Perfect use of porcelain
                    would be on the front teeth where biting stresses are smallest and need for esthetic appearance is
                    greatest. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Metal-alloys</span> <span> Gold crowns fall into this category of materials.
                    Historically this is the least esthetic material however it has been time tested and found to have
                    the longest service life. In addition this material allows  the restoration to be more conservative
                    thereby saving more tooth structure. This material is ideal for teeth with low esthetic but high
                    stress environments such as molar teeth on someone who has a  clenching or grinding habit. </span>
