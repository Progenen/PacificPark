        <p>Fixing a denture to implants is the ultimate level of stability. There is zero mobility in the prosthesis
            while rivaling the functionality and esthetics of natural teeth.</p>

        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>A fixed denture or sometimes also called an All-On-4 is a fixed prosthetic that is held by 4 to 6 implants to
            the arch of the jaw. The action of implant fixation allows the prosthesis to be as comfortable and reliable
            in function as natural teeth. When done properly and with care the final result is spectacular, restoring
            complete function, as well as bringing back confidence of smile and speech.</p>
        <div class="landing__image"> <img src="images/landing-img102.png" alt=""> </div>
        <p>The prosthesis is fixed to the implants by aid of screws. This eliminates any movement or rocking of the
            fixed denture. Also because there is no intimate contact between the denture and gums, there will never be
            sore spots. These factors allow for the best comfort and function outcomes.</p>
        <p class="text-center"> A fixed denture excels in these aspects: </p>
        <ul center="">
            <li>Esthetic and functional replacement of teeth</li>
            <li>Increased comfort during function</li>
            <li>Bone volume retention in increased due to presence of implants</li>
        </ul>

        </ul>
        <h2>How it is accomplished</h2>
        <p>Typically implants are placed at the first surgical appointment. If tooth removal and bone grafting is
            necessary, it is done during the same appointment. See Implant, Extraction and Bone graft menu items for
            more procedure info.</p>

                src="images/landing-img100.png" alt=""> </div>
        <p> After tooth removal and implantation process a temporary denture is hooked up to the implants if the
            stability allows to do so. Typically we try to have a functional temporary denture hooked up to the implants
            by the end of the surgical appointment. Sometimes that process is broken into two appointment if we need to
            spend extra time on the project to achieve better initial results. After the initial appointment it takes
            anywhere from 3-5 months of healing to begin fabrication of final prosthesis </p>
        <div class="landing__image"> <img src="images/landing-img99.png" alt=""> </div>
        <p>At the end of the healing phase the final prosthesis can be made out of two different materials. Either
            titanium reinforced acrylic or zirconia ceramic, both of which have great esthetic and functional outcomes.

        <h2>Materials</h2>
        <ul class="landing__list-curname">
            <li> <span class="text-right">Acrylic</span> <span> These prostheses are made of PMMA
                    (poly-methyl-methacrylate) material. This type of acrylic is strong enough to support the chewing
                    forces while offering a great degree of reparability and flexibility in future modifications.
                    However the use of clasps and retentive features is limited. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Titanium
                    Reinforced
                    Acrylic</span> <span> This is traditional denture material that has been reinforced with a titanium
                    bar on the inside of the prosthesis. An advantage of this material that it is long lasting and
                    easily repairable if any of the acrylic is broken or worn off. The common disadvantage is that
                    acrylic teeth tend to wear within 5-10 years of use and will need to be replaced at some point in
                    the future. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Zirconia</span> <span> Extremely hard material that does not allow any natural
                    color of the tooth to shine through. Great when trying to drastically change the color of tooth,
                    however can appear opaque and color may lack depth. </span> </li>
