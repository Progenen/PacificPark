        <h2>How it is accomplished</h2>
        <p class="text-center"> Typically implants are placed at the first surgical appointment. If tooth removal is
            necessary it is accomplished during this appointment. </p>

        <p class="text-center">After tooth removal the process of denture fabrication begins with impression of residual
            ridges. After multiple fittings the final denture will feature an acrylic base that will support plastic
            teeth.</p>

        <p class="text-center">Once the final denture is fabricated special anchors are installed into the plastic base
            to enable the dentures snap onto the implant.</p>

                    (poly-methyl-methacrylate) material. This type of acrylic is strong enough to support the chewing
                    forces while offering a great degree of reparability and flexibility in future modifications.
                    However the use of clasps and retentive features is limited. </span> </li>
