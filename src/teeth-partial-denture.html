        <h2>How it is accomplished</h2>
        <p class="text-center"> The process of partial denture fabrication begins with making sure that the remaining
            teeth have enough
            health and strength to support added stresses of a prosthesis </p>

        <p class="text-center">After multiple impressions and fittings the final result will feature metal or acrylic
            frames that will cover certain area of tissue. This can cause minor discomfort at which point the partials
            will be adjusted.</p>

        <p class="text-center">The discomfort of the new prostheses usually disappears within two weeks after the
            adjustments and delivery has been done</p>

                    (poly-methyl-methacrylate) material. This type of acrylic is strong enough to support the chewing
                    forces while offering a great degree of reparability and flexibility in future modifications.
                    However the use of clasps and retentive features is limited. </span> </li>
            <li> <span class="text-right">Metal-acrylic</span> <span> These prostheses are made of PMMA acrylic as well
                    as nickel-cobalt alloy frame for reinforcement. This type of prosthesis is much stiffer and may
                    offer greater stability due to a more exact design and increased strength of clasping mechanisms.
                    However ability to repair or modify this prosthesis is greatly reduced due to the rigidity of the
                    frame </span> </li>
