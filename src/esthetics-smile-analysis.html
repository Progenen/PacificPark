        <h2>What it is</h2>
        <p>A Smile Analysis workshop details benefits and shortcomings of the existing anatomical structures. Not only
            teeth but also everting that surrounds teeth.</p>
        <div class="landing__image landing__image--triple6 landing__image--arrownone landing__image--fix1"> <img
                src="images/landing-img202.png" alt=""> <img src="images/landing-img203.png" alt=""> <img
                src="images/landing-img204.png" alt=""> </div>
        <p>During a smile design session multiple photographs are taken and analyzed as well as a 3D scan of the
            anatomical structures of the mouth. Once the existing anatomy is captured on film we will ask the patient to
            tell us about their esthetic concerns.
            These concerns can include but are not limited to:</p>
        <ul m-auto pl-28 center="">
            <li>Restorations</li>
            <li>Defects</li>
            <li>Exposed Roots</li>
            <li>Midline Tilt</li>
            <li>Midline Shift</li>
            <li>Staining and Coloring</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="landing__image"> <img src="images/landing-img205.png" alt=""> </div>
        <p>Once we know the primary concerns our design team will address these concerns and improve the existing smile
            by proposing a new design that will be presented at the following appointment.</p>
        <h2>How it is accomplished</h2>
        <p>Once the design is ready a mold of the new tooth anatomy is created which is applied to the patients teeth
            with self curing temporary dental acrylic. This will allow the patient to examine a brand new smile in
            action while having this effect completely harmless and reversible.</p>
